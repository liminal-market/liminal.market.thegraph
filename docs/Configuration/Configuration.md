The app-specific config files for `liminal.market.thegraph` are `networks.json` and `subgraph.yaml`. These files are used to configure the application and provide necessary information for its proper functioning.

`networks.json` is a configuration file that contains information about various networks and their associated contracts. It includes the contract addresses and the starting block numbers for each contract on different networks such as Mumbai, Matic, and Fuji.

Here's an example of usage for the app-specific configs:

```json
{
  "mumbai": {
    "LiminalMarket": {
      "address": "0x0D8c3D4F4B29EfC3c54172803dA8a7f1CA2E6189",
      "startBlock": 32211000
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

In this example, the `networks.json` file provides the address and start block for the LiminalMarket contract on the Mumbai network.

`subgraph.yaml` is another configuration file used in the application. However, the content of this file is not provided in the given text. Generally, `subgraph.yaml` is used in The Graph projects to define the structure of a subgraph, including data sources, entities, and event handlers.

As for the other configuration files, without more information, it is not possible to provide a general description of them.
